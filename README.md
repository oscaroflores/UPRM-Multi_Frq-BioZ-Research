## About

The goal of this project is to use the MAX30009 with MAX32655, in tandem, to create a analog front end system that can record impedance measurements at multiple frequencies. The finalized system will integrate bluetooth communication between sensor and host computer, SD card additional storage to store all measurement logs, and a user computer interface to interact with the system.

This research effort is being made possible by a passionate team of professors and engineering students as part of the UPRM's Industrial Affiliates Program.

## Software

The code is divided into two separate repositories. The current repository contains all the code flashed into the microcontroller. This code determines how the hardware functions. The second repository for this project is of the GUI application, which serves as the visual medium for the measurements being taken by the MAX30009.

The github repo for the GUI application can be found here: https://github.com/blancoricardo1/BioZApp
